There isn't one content format when it comes to Value4Value. When it comes to podcasting, including your listeners into the feedback
and content-creation loop is tried and tested.

By including your audience into [the feedback loop][loop] you create something
bigger than yourself, something *participatory* and *reciprocal*.

From shout-outs to numerology, and honors to badges, many things can
be added to your content in creative ways that include your audience into the
content creation process.
